# Slack-Like System Architecture Report

## Top-Level Description
This document outlines the architecture of a Slack-like communication platform. The system consists of multiple components interacting to provide real-time messaging, user management, and channel functionalities.

## Detailed Description of Each Architecture Element
### Frontend
- **Technology**: React.js
- **Role**: Handles the user interface rendering.
- **Details**: Single-page application built with React Router for navigation.

### Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Role**: Manages server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Details**: RESTful APIs for handling user authentication, message storage, and retrieval.

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **Role**: Stores user data, messages, and other metadata.
- **Details**: Relational database schema designed for efficient querying and scalability.

### Real-Time Messaging
- **Technology**: WebSocket
- **Role**: Enables real-time communication between clients and server.
- **Details**: WebSockets are used for push notifications and instant message delivery.

### CI Pipeline Stages
1. **Git**: Developers push code changes to the Git repository.
2. **Build**: Continuous integration tool builds the application using a Dockerfile.
3. **Test**: Automated tests run to ensure code quality.
   - **Unit Tests**: Verify individual units of source code.
   - **Integration Tests**: Ensure different parts of the application work together.
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-world usage scenarios.
4. **Deploy**: If all tests pass, the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Monitor**: Monitoring tools track the performance and health of the application.
